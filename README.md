# A.C.T.I.G. — Offline On-Device AI Assistant for iPad & iPhone

A Jarvis-style, fully **offline** AI assistant that runs **directly on your iPad
Pro 13" (M4)** *and on iPhone*. It's a **universal app**: every function works on
both, with layouts that adapt to each screen and orientation. Built as a Swift
Playgrounds app so you can download, build and run it **on the device itself — no
Mac required**.

On activation it greets you — by voice and text:
> **"Welcome sir, ACTIG at your service sir, how may I assist you sir."**

> **Read this first:** Some things you might expect from a "take over the whole
> device" assistant are **not possible on a normal iPad** — Apple's sandbox
> forbids them, and a couple are physically impossible. A.C.T.I.G. delivers the
> full, real version of everything that *is* possible and is honest about the
> rest. See [`docs/CAPABILITIES.md`](docs/CAPABILITIES.md) for the exact
> requirement-by-requirement breakdown, and [`docs/JAILBREAK.md`](docs/JAILBREAK.md)
> for the features that only a jailbroken device could reach.

## What it does (all on-device, all offline)

- 🧠 **Local LLM brain** — runs entirely on the M4. Default engine is Apple's
  on-device **Foundation Models** (Apple Intelligence, zero download). Optional
  **MLX + Qwen2.5-3B** for a custom model. Always-available offline **stub**
  fallback so the app never breaks.
- 🔵 **Jarvis hologram UI** — a draggable blue hologram chat box + pulsing core
  that floats over whatever you're doing **inside the app**. Type, attach
  files/images, or talk.
- 🎙️ **Voice in/out with barge-in** — on-device speech-to-text, a crisp
  mechanical "Jarvis" voice, and **interruption**: start talking while it's
  replying and it stops instantly so you can restate.
- 🗣️ **Wake / sleep** — say **"wake up ACTIG"** to come online and
  **"shut down all systems"** to go dormant. A **Siri Shortcut** ("Hey Siri,
  wake up ACTIG") launches it hands-free from anywhere.
- 🧊 **3D modelling project space** — call up shapes by voice, touch, or hand;
  multiply, resize, move, drag, swap, and **undo/redo** with **autosave**.
- ✋ **Camera hand control** — opt-in pinch-to-grab finger control of 3D shapes
  with **no screen touch** (front camera + Vision hand tracking).
- 🔎 **Camera object analysis** — point the camera at something, say "scan this",
  and A.C.T.I.G. identifies it (classification + on-image text + colour) and
  answers questions about it.

## Download, install & run on iPad or iPhone (no Mac)

Swift Playgrounds runs on both iPadOS and iOS, so the same steps work on either
device. (iPhone screens are smaller, so the hologram panel spans the width and
the 3D toolbar scrolls — every control is still there.)

1. **Install Swift Playgrounds** (4.5 or later) from the App Store — it's free
   (available on both iPad and iPhone).
2. **Get the project onto the device.** Either:
   - Clone/download this repo and AirDrop the `ACTIG.swiftpm` folder to the
     device, then tap it — it opens straight in Swift Playgrounds; **or**
   - In Swift Playgrounds tap **＋ → App**, then recreate the files from this repo.
3. **Open `ACTIG.swiftpm`** in Swift Playgrounds.
4. Tap **▶ Run**. On first launch, grant **Microphone**, **Speech Recognition**
   and **Camera** permissions when prompted.
5. (Optional, recommended) Add the **"Wake up ACTIG"** Siri phrase: it's
   registered automatically via App Shortcuts, so just say **"Hey Siri, wake up
   ACTIG"**. You can also find it in the Shortcuts app.

That's it — after setup it runs **fully offline**. Put the iPad in Airplane Mode
and it still works.

### Choosing the brain (model)

| Engine | Setup | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Apple Foundation Models** (default) | None | On-device Apple Intelligence (iPadOS 26+, M-series). Zero download. |
| **MLX + Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct 4-bit** | Uncomment the MLX lines in `Package.swift` | ~1.8 GB one-time download, then offline. Best for a custom/larger model. |
| **Offline stub** | Automatic fallback | No real reasoning — keeps the UI/voice loop working if no model is available. |

The app auto-selects the best available engine at launch (see
`Brain/LLMEngine.swift` → `LLMEngineFactory`).

## How to talk to it (examples)

| You say / type | What happens |
|---|---|
| "wake up ACTIG" | Comes online, hologram appears |
| "bring up the 3D project" | Opens the 3D modelling space |
| "add a cube", "make three spheres", "multiply the box five times" | Creates shapes |
| "make it bigger", "shrink it", "swap positions", "delete it" | Edits the selection |
| "undo" / "redo" | Steps backward/forward through your actions |
| "enable camera controls" | Turns on pinch-to-grab finger control |
| "scan this" / "what is this?" (camera mode) | Analyses the object and answers |
| "shut down all systems" | Goes dormant |

## License & honesty

A.C.T.I.G. never accesses other apps' private data, accounts, or credentials —
iPadOS forbids it and it's a security boundary worth keeping. See
[`docs/CAPABILITIES.md`](docs/CAPABILITIES.md).
